# InternIntelligence_LoanApprovalPrediction
This repository contains my first internship project for **InternIntelligence** as part of my Data Science remote internship.
## 🚀 Project: Loan Approval Prediction
### 📌 Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details.
### 📊 Dataset
- Dataset Source: [Kaggle – Loan Approval Prediction] (https://www.kaggle.com/code/sanaharoon123/loan-approval-prediction)  
- Features include applicant income, loan amount, credit score, employment status, and assets.
### 🛠️ Steps Followed
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – cleaned and prepared dataset.
2. **Model Development** – trained a machine learning classification model.
3. **Model Evaluation** – evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Deployment** – built an interactive Streamlit app for predictions.
### ⚙️ Files in this Repo
- `Loan_Approval_Notebook.ipynb` → Jupyter/Kaggle notebook with full analysis & training  
- `loan_approval_model.pkl` → Trained ML model  
- `app.py` → Streamlit app for loan prediction  
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies to run the project  
### ▶️ How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/InternIntelligence_LoanApprovalPrediction.git
   cd InternIntelligence_LoanApprovalPrediction
2. Install dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:
    streamlit run app.py
4.Open the link shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) and use the web app to test loan approvals.
📽️ Internship Requirement
This project was completed as Task 1 for my Data Science internship at InternIntelligence.
A demo video will be uploaded on my LinkedIn profile with the hashtag #internintelligence and tag @InternIntelligence.
